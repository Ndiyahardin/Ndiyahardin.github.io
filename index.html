  Introduction

         My idea is a performance arts club all around the city of Richmond and all ages. My mission is a performance arts club where you can sing no matter what age you are and you can learn different  dynamics of singing. My vision is to have this big group of amazing talented people and we can just have fun and learn new things and stick together especially with a lot of violence going on and we can make a change in the city of richmond.


  Body

             This is my idea because i love to sing and singing helps me calm when i'm stressed and my grandma would always sing to me before she passed so it's very important to me and i know i'm not the only one out there so i wanted to make this performance arts club because no one should feel like there alone so i think this would be good. How is it in line with your passion, experience, interests? I sing at my aunt's church and at school so I have experience and I love to sing and I'm very passionate about singing that's why I want to go to college for performing arts. Also my logistics of this idea is planned out to meet 3 days a week and to  start off we will be meeting in  a school.
